This projects demonstrate the use of a "subscribe" scheduler, 
which makes sure that all "upstream" observables 
(e.g. observables connected to the observable that is getting
 subscribed to) are subscribed before the first element is emitted.
 
The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY).
